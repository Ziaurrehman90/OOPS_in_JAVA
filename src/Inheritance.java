//    Inheritance is one of the four pillars of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).
//    It allows one class (called child / subclass / derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (called parent / superclass / base class).
//ava supports single inheritance, multilevel inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, and hybrid inheritance (through interfaces).
//Multiple inheritance with classes is NOT supported (to avoid ambiguity, a.k.a. “Diamond Problem”), but it is possible with interfaces.
